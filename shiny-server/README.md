*All tools presented below may contain bugs, please let me know if you find some. Each tool relies on dependencies normally listed at the top of the code (cpan for perl and cran for R will help you add them)*

For users, please refer to the accompanying readme file in the folder of the application for instructions for use.

For programmers, app scripts can also be copied and modified for own use (server or local). Read the header of each App.R to find out which packages you need to install on your server to have the code do its job (the App.R header will also contain the packages used only in subscripts it sources, directly or indirectly, if any).

### **TraVis Pies** 

The **TraVis Pies** app creates tracer metabolomics pie chart plot images as proposed in the manuscript TraVis Pies: An intuitive visualization approach for stable-isotope tracer metabolomics. The user uploads input, then tests visualisation settings interactively on a compound of choice to see what the pie chart would look like, and can then generate and download pie chart plot images with these settings for all the compounds in their input data. Please refer to the accompanying readme file in the folder of the application for further instructions for use.
