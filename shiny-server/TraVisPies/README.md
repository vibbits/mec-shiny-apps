### **TraVis Pies** 

The **TraVis Pies** app creates tracer metabolomics pie chart plot images as proposed in the manuscript TraVis Pies: An intuitive visualization approach for stable-isotope tracer metabolomics. The user uploads input, then tests visualisation settings interactively on a compound of choice to see what the pie chart would look like, and can then generate and download pie chart plot images with these settings for all the compounds in their input data.
